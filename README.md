Using a single stack we convert from infix to postfix. We first check for any arithmetic errors that might cause problems later in the calculation. Then we check for negatives, operators, and digits to form an ordered postfix. Then we use the same stack and we start to evaluate the postfix. The remaining integer in the stack is the answer.
